# Self-Evaluation

## Time Spent
I spent approximately 40 hours on this assignment. This time included understanding the requirements, setting up MongoDB, writing and debugging the code, creating and manipulating the database, and ensuring the output met the requirements.

## Effort and Grade Assessment
Based on my effort, I would say I earned an A grade. I dedicated a significant amount of time and energy to understanding the assignment thoroughly and ensuring that my solution was complete and accurate.

## Solution Quality
Based on my solution, I believe I earned an A grade. I successfully created a MongoDB collection, inserted relevant data, and executed various queries to demonstrate the functionality. My solution addresses all the given criteria effectively.

## Summary of Issues and Solutions
One of the challenges was coming up with player names and ensuring the information was accurate and unique. To address this, I implemented a code that generates random names and inserts data automatically, which gives the dataset its uniqueness and variety. I found a tutorial on YouTube that guided me through this process.
